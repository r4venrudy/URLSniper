Description:
-------------
Rudy Discord URL Sniper is a high-speed Discord automation utility designed to
retrieve and resolve Discord server invite URLs as soon as they become
available. The project focuses on extreme execution speed and minimal latency,
prioritizing rapid detection over analysis or enrichment.

This tool is engineered for performance testing, automation research, and
closed-environment experimentation. It is not an OSINT tool and does not perform
data collection, scanning, or intelligence analysis.

--------------------------------------------------

Core Purpose:
-------------
- Ultra-fast Discord invite URL retrieval
- Near-instant execution timing (sub-millisecond focus)
- Server-level invite resolution
- Latency-optimized workflow design

--------------------------------------------------

Features:
---------
1. High-Speed URL Retrieval Engine
   - Optimized execution path
   - Minimal logic overhead
   - Focus on fastest possible response time
   - Designed for competitive timing environments

2. Passive Server Presence
   - Operates from an existing account context
   - No command-based interaction
   - No message parsing or content analysis
   - Zero OSINT functionality

3. Performance-Oriented Architecture
   - No unnecessary logging
   - No external API dependencies
   - No enrichment or metadata processing
   - Built purely for speed

4. Stability-Focused Design
   - Handles unavailable or restricted servers
   - Graceful failure handling
   - No crash behavior under invalid states

--------------------------------------------------

Requirements:
-------------
- Node.js runtime
- Discord environment access
- Controlled testing environment
- High-resolution timing support

--------------------------------------------------

Installation:
-------------
This project is intended for controlled environments only.

Clone the repository and install required dependencies as defined in the
package configuration.

--------------------------------------------------

Usage:
------
- The tool operates automatically once initialized
- No user-facing commands
- URL resolution occurs as soon as conditions are met
- Output is returned immediately upon success

--------------------------------------------------

Output:
-------
- Raw Discord invite URL (if obtainable)
- No formatting
- No enrichment
- No storage unless explicitly added

--------------------------------------------------

Performance Notes:
------------------
- Designed with speed as the only priority
- No safety checks beyond stability handling
- Benchmarking-oriented implementation
- Execution time measured in microseconds

--------------------------------------------------

Limitations:
------------
- No OSINT features
- No analysis, scanning, or validation
- No moderation or security functionality
- Not designed for public deployment
